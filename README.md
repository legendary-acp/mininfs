# MiniNFS â€“ A Toy Networked File Server

## ðŸ§© Concept:
Implement a simplified NFS-style file server that supports basic operations over TCP from a remote client:
```
    LIST â†’ list directory contents
    READ <filename> â†’ stream contents
    WRITE <filename> â†’ upload and save a file
```
